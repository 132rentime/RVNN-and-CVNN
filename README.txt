DEBUGGING
TO DO

1) learn with iteration instead of ER Value comparison 
	- because ER gets very small, if the values are small, so it is not reliable
2) get the weights values right
	- depending of the size of the values, the tanh function does not work anymore
	- weights or data have to be adapted (weights preferred)
3) denoising autoencoder for more then one signal vector
4) bias setting for complex values needed


5) stacked denoising autoencoder
	sigmoid function for complex values needed

TEST
1) Test Data needed
2) plotting of the results
